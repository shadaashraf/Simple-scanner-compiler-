# Document Retrieval System

## Overview
This project implements a Document Retrieval System, allowing users to search and analyze documents efficiently. It employs various text processing techniques such as tokenization, stop-word removal, and TF-IDF weighting to enhance document retrieval accuracy.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Document Retrieval System, ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system along with the required dependencies. You can install them using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy


## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

Main Script (main.py): Contains the core functionality of the Document Retrieval System, including tokenization, stop-word removal, TF-IDF computation, and cosine similarity calculation.
Data Folder (DocumentCollection/): Contains the collection of documents (in .txt format) to be indexed and searched.
Usage
Indexing Documents: Place your text documents in the DocumentCollection folder. Run the main.py script to index these documents and prepare them for retrieval.
Querying Documents: Once the documents are indexed, users can input search queries. The system will return relevant documents based on the provided query.
##Features
Tokenization: Breaks down documents into individual words or tokens.
Stop-word Removal: Removes common words (e.g., "the," "is") that do not contribute significantly to document relevance.
